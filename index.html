  <h1>Internship at Avisi by Felix</h1>
<p>
I'm Felix Remke and I'm from the Goethe-Gymnasium Ibbenb√ºren. We had to do a three-day internship and I'm very interested in working with computers and programming so I wanted to do something like that. I knew that Sander was working at some sort of IT-company so I asked him if I could do it at his company and as you can see it worked out.</p>

<h4>Monday 15/5/2017:</h4>

<p>The first thing I've learned here is that nearly everyone drinks much coffee, so the first thing we did as we came here was to get a coffee.  Then Sander and I went around and Sander showed me some of the offices, who works there and what they do. After that Sander gave me an introduction over programming and how the internet was invented. Now we had to fill a 1h gap so we decided the best thing to do would be to look at the site code.org and how it works (how to code there). Next Geert teached me about System-Integration,  Security, showed me github and showed me an App with which you can draw a code so the customer can understand it better and quicker. After that Sander, Robin and I went to lunch. Kevin showed me how he creates the Design of apps with marvelapp and teached me how to use it. I started to design my app for the whole afternoon.

<p>First I started to programm my project from yesterday, wich was a "controllable line". After I finished it I worked on my Chat app so it would work "one-sided". This was very complicated so Sander had to help me with it so it would work. We did'nt finish it all the way but we finished so that you could see it works. In the afternoon I went on with my app design.</p>



<h4>Wednesday 17/5/2017:</h4>

<p>Firstofall Sander and I went to the coffee machine as we did everyday, then i worked on my App a little bit so you can understand it better. Going on Sander and I talked about how a real chat app would work and that it would be very complicated. Now I'm writing this blogpost and then I'm gonna get myself another coffee. If you want to see my App-prototype here's a video:
